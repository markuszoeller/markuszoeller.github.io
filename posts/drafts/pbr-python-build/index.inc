    We then walk Git history back to the last release. Within each commit
    we look for a Sem-Ver: pseudo header and, if found, parse it looking

    wedge pbr or break their tree), but we will emit an info-level warning
    message. The following symbols are recognized:

        feature
        api-break
        deprecation
        bugfix
