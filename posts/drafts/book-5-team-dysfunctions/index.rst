===============================================
Recommendation: The Five Dysfunctions of a Team
===============================================

Each post should start with one paragraph which is an abstract of the post.
This paragraph should be enough for a reader to decide if they want to
read the post or not. It is best to keep this paragraph short and simple.
100 words or less is the limit, as this abstract is used as excerpt in the
list on the landing page and in the feed readers. This upper limit
of 100 words is also the amount of content someone should be able to read
in less than 20 seconds. Additionally, it fits on one small mobile screen.

Why you should read it
======================

.. todo:: You should read it because...

If you're not convinced by now, the next section will contain very specific
examples from the book, which might give you a better understanding where
I come from.


The 5 most noteworthy things
============================

Well, it's easy to pick the 5 most noteworthy things this time.
I'll start each point with a citation of the book and add my 2 cents
right after it.


1. Absence of trust
-------------------

    [...] teammates must get comfortable being vulnerable with one
    another. [This includes] weaknesses, skill deficiencies, interpersonal
    shortcomings, mistakes and requests for help.

.. todo:: my 2 cents



2. Fear of conflict
-------------------

    [Teams] in productive conflict know, that the only purpose is to
    produce the best possible solution in the shortest period of time.

.. todo:: my 2 cents


3. Lack of commitment
---------------------

    [...] causes of the lack of commitment are the desire for
    consensus and the need for certainty.

.. todo:: my 2 cents



4. Avoidance of accountability
------------------------------

    [...] team members who are particularly close to one another
    sometimes hesitate to hold one another accountable [...]. [This]
    causes the relationship to deteriorate as team members begin to
    resent each other for not living up to expectations and for
    allowing the standards of the group to erode. [...] The enemy
    of accountability is ambiguity.

.. todo:: my 2 cents



5. Inattention to results
-------------------------

    [...] the tendency of members to care about something other
    than the collective goals of the group [...] [like] team status and
    individual status [...].

.. todo:: my 2 cents

it.
