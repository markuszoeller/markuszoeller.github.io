Recommendation: The Five Dysfunctions of a Team
===============================================

Did you ever wonder why you're (again) in a meeting without a clear result?
Do you feel like the topics got already discussed in a previous meeting?
How often did your hear the sentence `**Someone** should work on that.`?
Let's be honest, our work family is sometimes a little dysfunctional.
Join me in my personal reflection of the book
`The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable` from 2002 by
*Patrick Lencioni*, which helps to understand what's happening.

Why you should read it
======================

.. todo:: You should read it because...

If you're not convinced by now, the next section will contain very specific
examples from the book, which might give you a better understanding where
I come from.


The 5 most noteworthy things
============================

Well, it's easy to pick the 5 most noteworthy things this time.
I'll start each point with a citation of the book and add my 2 cents
right after it.


1. Absence of trust
-------------------

    [...] teammates must get comfortable being vulnerable with one
    another. [This includes] weaknesses, skill deficiencies, interpersonal
    shortcomings, mistakes and requests for help.

.. todo:: my 2 cents



2. Fear of conflict
-------------------

    [Teams] in productive conflict know, that the only purpose is to
    produce the best possible solution in the shortest period of time.

.. todo:: my 2 cents


3. Lack of commitment
---------------------

    [...] causes of the lack of commitment are the desire for
    consensus and the need for certainty.

.. todo:: my 2 cents



4. Avoidance of accountability
------------------------------

    [...] team members who are particularly close to one another
    sometimes hesitate to hold one another accountable [...]. [This]
    causes the relationship to deteriorate as team members begin to
    resent each other for not living up to expectations and for
    allowing the standards of the group to erode. [...] The enemy
    of accountability is ambiguity.

.. todo:: my 2 cents



5. Inattention to results
-------------------------

    [...] the tendency of members to care about something other
    than the collective goals of the group [...] [like] team status and
    individual status [...].

.. todo:: my 2 cents

This book gave me a lot of insights and I enjoyed reading and learning from
it.
