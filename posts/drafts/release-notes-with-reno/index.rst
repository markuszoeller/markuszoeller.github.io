=========================
Release Notes with *reno*
=========================



*"What features merged since the last release?"* --
*"Did we introduce something which might break a deployment?"* --
*"Let me grep through the commit history to check what happened."*
Remember sentences like these when you're about to release? If you
like this fire-fighting mode, ignore this post. If you want to have a
more relaxed release, this post will show you how to use a tool called
*reno* to manage your release notes.
