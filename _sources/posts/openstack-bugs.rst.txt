    This link is deprecated. I came to the conclusion, that the content is
    more easy to maintain when each post is in its own folder including the
    used images and code files. For example, all images will be copied to
    the folder "_images". This could lead to a name conflict some day. I was
    also worried that when I use an image in multiple posts, that I forget this
    and update the image to reflect something in post A and in post B it
    doesn't make sense anymore.

.. note::

    This link is not valid anymore. The post got moved
    to :doc:`/posts/2015/12/01/openstack-bugs`
