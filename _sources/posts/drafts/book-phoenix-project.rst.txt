The 5 most noteworthy things
============================

I'll start each point with a citation of the book and add my 2 cents
right after it.


1. Work In Progress
-------------------

    WIP is one of the root causes for chronic due-date problems,
    quality issues, and expediters. [...] WIP is the silent killer.

The really great thing about this point is, you can fix that on your own
without relying on somebody else. My very personal rule-of-thumb is, three
items max at any given time. Your results may vary. Also, what size these
items are is also a very personal thing. If they overlap, great,
if they are 100% distinct, 3 contexts is the maximum my mind can handle.

If you work in a company where the culture is very reporting focused,
you might face a situation where having *a lot of things in progress*
is considered to be good thing, while *finishing a few items* might be
less recognized as an effort. Unfortunately, I don't have a solution to
that, as it also depends on your values and motivation.


2. Bottleneck
-------------

    [...] it should be based on the tempo of how quickly the
    bottleneck resource can consume work.

3. Improvements
---------------

    [...] any improvements made anywhere besides the bottleneck
    are an illusion.

4. Operations
-------------

    It's not the upfront capital that kills you, it's the
    operations and maintenance on the back end.

5. Flow
-------

    [...] as important as throttling the release of work
    is managing the handoffs. [...] goal is to maximize
    the flow.
