About
=====

I'm Markus Zoeller and I'm with IBM since early 2013. I work on OpenStack
since April 2014 and I'm mainly focused on the *Nova* project. In case you want
to reach me in real time, my IRC handle is ``markus_z`` and I'm living in the
timezone ``UTC+1``.

This blog intends to persist some things I'd like to share with others or
don't want to forget. English is not my first language. If you see
spelling and/or grammar errors, tell me about it by opening an
`issue <https://github.com/markuszoeller/blog-source/issues>`_
